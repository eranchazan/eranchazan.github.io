      The benefits of version control are plentiful. Some examples are as follows.  It allows you to go back to ealier versions of your code, to maintain multiple versions of your code, to see the difference between two (or more) versions of your code, to review the history of some code, to submit a change to someone else's code, to share your code, or let other people work on your code, to see how much work is being done, and where, when and by whome, and lastly to experiment with a new feature without interfering with working code.

      Git helps you keep track of your changes by logging every commit that has been made. A commit is a log of each change to the repository. Each commit comes with a brief header line that summarizes the purpose of the commit. Information such as why it was done along with by whom and when is written are here. Following the header line is the body paragraph (separated by a empty line) that goes into more detail about why the commit was made and what the code means.

        You should store your code on GitHub because it will never be lost since it's on the cloud. It is password protected to keep all your code safe. It enables you to get help if you need it by allowing others who you give access to to look at it and make changes with their own versions of your code. And lastly it is how employeers today hire. Today they look at your GitHub account like a resume by viewing your code and seeing your abilities.
