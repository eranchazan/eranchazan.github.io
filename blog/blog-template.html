			How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?
			Working with a pair on this assignment was vey pleasent. We were able to work together to determine best design choices both graphically in the wireframe and syntactically in the HTML document. Working in a pair also enabled me to play the driver and really focus on nailing down the HTML syntax. I learned conceptually that HTML elements are like containers inside containers inside even larger containers. 

			Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?
			Wireframing was essential in creating a blueprint of our website. It transported my initial thoughts into a visial layout thus allowing me to begin the design process.  

			What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe? 
			We decided that a good wireframe was a minimal viable product. That means we only had the essential boxes to make the webstie function. We wanted our page to breath, that means not to cluttered. All boxes had adequate space between themselvers and their neighbors. 

			What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any) ?
			I learned about the <h1>,<h2>, ect... and the <div> tages. These elements very fundamental in HTML code.
