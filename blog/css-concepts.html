   <p>What is the difference between Margin, Border, and Padding?</p>

  <p>
  When you desgin webpages it is very important to be able to design a layout that makes the user experience of your site top notch. When designing your website you can decide where each button goes. To do this you can manipulate the Margin, Border, and Padding of each element in your website to the design objective of your choice. When you change the margin you are changing the area between the element and the space of others around it. If you want to make more room between your buttons you increase the margin. Border is the actual outline of the element itself. If you want to style the color, thickness, or shape of the outine of your buttons you do it here. And finally padding is the area of the element itself. If you want to increase the size of your button from a half square inch on the screen to three square inches on the screen you do it here. You can also change the color, shape, and font inside the element here too.
