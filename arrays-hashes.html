<h2> Assignment 4.8 Arrays and Hashes</h2>
<h4>10.5.2015</h4>

<p>An array is an ordered collection of objects separated by commas and wrapped inside brackets. An object in an array can either be a string, integer, boolean, or even another array itself.
</p>
						Array_1 = [1, 4, "sting", true]
<p>
 Strings are sequences of characters (most often letters) always wrapped in quotes. Integers are numbers, and booleans are true/false values. An array is a sequence of these objects with a corresponding positioned number starting at position zero, and not one! Position numbers act like aliases that act as other ways to manipulate/analyze/ and access its corresponding object. Array numberical positions can be accessed by placing the numberical valye in square brackets placed after the array name.  
</p>

								Array_1[0] = 1
<p>
A Hash is also an ordered collection of key:value pairs separated by commas and wrapped in curly brackets. A key:value pair is analogous to a word and its definition in a dictionary. The key is the unique identifier (or word) separated by a colon with its partnering value ( or definition).Hashes substitutes the numerical value in arrays with another object. Hashes allow you to do lookup operations based on keys.   
</p>								
			state_hash = {"Conneticut": "CT", "Delaware": "DE","New Jersey": "NJ"}
<p>
To create a key:valye pair in Hashes, you write the key value followed by an equal sign and greater than sign followed by the value. 
</p>
							"Conneticut" => "CT"
							"Delaware"=> "DE"
