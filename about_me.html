	Hi, my name is Eran Chazan and I am a student at DBC for the 2015 Fall Semester. I have a background in GIS (Geographical Information Systems). Only recently did I decide that I want to go from a GIS Technician to a Web Map Developer. To become a Web Map Developer I need to become a Web Developer. And that is where DBC comes into play. I'm a proud Copperhead, not sure what animal that is... But have enjoyed the intense experience in Phase-0 so far.

	My interests and hobbies include skateboarding, playing soccer, basketball, and football. I love listening to NPR and studying Cartography. I'm a geo-nerd who studies the capitals and national flags of the world.

	I was born in Jerusalem, Israel in 1988, and grew up in Piedmont, CA. I have two older brothers and two cats. I'm a huge Oakland Athelics, Raiders, and Warriors fan. I also am a religous Cal football follower. I graduated from UC Berkeley in 2011, and have traveled to England, Ireland, France, and Israel since I finished my studies.

	 Something quirky about me is that I'm a huge neat-freek and must have everyting in ordely fashion before I can do anything productive.
