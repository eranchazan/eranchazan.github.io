<p>
Ruby on rails (or simply Rails) is an opensource web application framewor--i.e. a software framework that is designed to suport the development of dynamic websites, web applications, web services and web resources aimed to alleviate the overhead associated with common activities carried out in web development. Rails is a <b>software library</b> that extends the Ruby programming language created by <i>David Heinemeir</i> in 2005. It is written under the MIT License agreement and facilitates the use of webs standards such as JSON and XML for data transfer, and HTML, CSS and JavaScript for display and user interfacing to create a web application that runs on a web server. 
</p>
<p>
Rails is the central project of a vast community that produces software libraries that simplify the task fo building complex websites. Rails is popular among web startups because of the pool of open source software libraries(i.e. Ruby gems). Ruby was chosen over other languages such as PHP and Java due to its "clean abstraction" behavior which enable Ruby to be devloped into <i>'domain specific language'</i>. Ruby is liked by many in the programming community due to its syntax that doesn't require a lot of punctuation and need for less code to create basic structures such as data fields.     
</p>
<p>
The benefit of using Rails is that every developer who learns the <i>“Rails way”</i> produces a web application that any other Rails developer can unravel and understand more quickly than if they encountered idiosyncratic code without as many conventions. That means collaboration is easier, development is quicker, and there’s a larger pool of open source libraries to enhance Rails.
</p>
<p>
Web servers deliver HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, either from static files that are stored on the server, or from an “application server” that creates files dynamically using a programming language such as Ruby. A software program written in Ruby and organized using Rails conventions is a “web application.” Rails combines the Ruby programming language with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a web application. Rails uses Ruby to dynamically assemble HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files from component files (often adding content from a database).
