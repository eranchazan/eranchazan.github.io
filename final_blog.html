 The process of developing my website was a very informative experience. I went from never making anyting even a static web page to making a multipage masterpiece. I learned about the great interplay between CSS and HTML to make styling multiple pages <i>much more efficient.</i> HTML plays its only crtiical role in creating in-line styling such as the styling of individual words or links. CSS has the critical role of creating "templates" for how the pages are designed and formatted for all tags that share the same name. Learning the basics of HTML/CSS is pretty easy after a while of trying, however learning all the capabilities takes much longer.

 Learning how to build my first website was a great experience on getting to being apart of a project every step of the way until it's done. It has showed me that it is actually not to difficult to build a simple webpage from the ground up after all. I learned about the modularity of technology and how you can separate the functionality into different files with each interacting to one another. If you want to add a picture to your website it's as simple as writing the relative path name to it on the computer.

  Lastly, learning about HTML/CSS was a great introductory language to learn before I started learning Ruby and JavaScript. It was a great way to get into the <i>way of thinking like a progammer</i> when I started learning object-oriented-languages.
